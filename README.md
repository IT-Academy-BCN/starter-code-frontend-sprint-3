This sprint focuses on JavaScript. The goal is to build a simple demo for an e-commerce web application, with a working shopping cart and applicable discounts on the products.

### ⭐ **Level 1** ⭐

**— Exercise 1**

Make the `buy()` function, which lets users add products to the shopping cart.

##### ✅ Finished: 20/01/2023

**— Exercise 2**

Make the `cleanCart()` function, which lets users empty the shopping cart.

##### ✅ Finished: 20/01/2023

**— Exercise 3**

Make the `calculateTotal()` function, which adds the price of every product in the shopping cart.

##### ✅ Finished: 20/01/2023

**— Exercise 4**

Make the `generateCart()` function, which generates an updated version of the shopping cart list but without repeated products (instead, it shows the quantity of each product.)

##### ✅ Finished: 22/01/2023

**— Exercise 5**

Make the `applyPromotionsCart()` function, which calculates the subtotal of certain products if promotions are applicable.

##### ✅ Finished: 23/01/2023

**— Exercise 6**

Make the `printCart()` function, which dinamically shows the user's cart list upon clicking the cart button at the top. Since the function was very long and did a lot of stuff, I broke it up into smaller functions.

✏️**Notes:**

- I learned that you can use the logical OR operator (`||`) instead of the ternary operator (`? :`) in certain circumstances, and it's more concise and easier to read.
